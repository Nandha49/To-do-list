# To-Do List Application

This is a simple, responsive, and user-friendly To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The application allows users to add tasks, view them in a list, and delete them as needed. It features an elegant UI with a gradient background and uses modern design principles.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the list.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Responsive and visually appealing design.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structuring the content.
- **CSS3** for styling, including gradient backgrounds and custom buttons.
- **Bootstrap 5** for responsive design and pre-styled components.
- **JavaScript** for dynamic functionality (adding and deleting tasks).


## How It Works

1. The user enters a task into the input field and clicks the "Add Task" button.
2. The task is added to the list below, displayed as a styled list item.
3. Each task includes a "Delete" button that allows the user to remove the task from the list.
